# Vaccination Data Analysis and Visualization
This project involves comprehensive analysis of global vaccination and disease incidence data using Python for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), and Power BI for visualizing key public health insights. The goal is to examine vaccination trends, assess the impact of vaccine programs, and uncover relationships between vaccination coverage and disease reduction.

# Project Objectives
Clean and explore five key datasets:

1.Vaccination Coverage

2.Incidence Rate

3.Reported Cases

4.Vaccine Introduction

5.Vaccine Schedule

-Analyze the relationship between vaccination rates and disease incidence.

-Create interactive dashboards to visualize and communicate findings.

-Address public health questions through data-driven insights.

# Tools and Technologies

1.Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

2.Power BI for data visualization

3.SQL for data storage and querying

4.Jupyter Notebook for EDA and data processing

# Key Insights
1.Trends in vaccine coverage over time and across regions

2.Correlation between vaccine introduction and reduction in disease incidence

3.Analysis of reported cases by antigen and country

4.Identification of regional disparities in vaccination rates and disease burden

# Future Scope
 Add demographic-based analysis (age groups, gender)

 Implement predictive modeling using machine learning

 Compare vaccine effectiveness across different countries and time periods
